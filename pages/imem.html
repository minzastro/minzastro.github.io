<p><strong>Introduction</strong> IMEM-1.1 is a computer program to evaluate number<br />
densities, fluxes and velocities of meteoroids in the interplanetary<br />
space and near Earth. It was developed under ESA contract N 21928. The<br />
abbreviation IMEM-1.1 stands for Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering<br />
Model (Version 1.1 stands for the updated version). It succeeds to the<br />
earlier versions of meteoroid models programmed by Divine [2] for<br />
NASA, Staubach for ESA (the DustMod program) and Dikarev also for ESA<br />
(old IMEM, see [3]). It is related to METEM by currently used by NASA.<br />
IMEM-1.1 can do a wide range of jobs. The program calculates fluxes,<br />
average impact velocities and the number densities of the dust particles<br />
subject to various selection effects due to the location and velocity of<br />
spacecraft in the Solar system, the orientation and field of view of the<br />
dust detector or another sensitive surface, and puts the results into an<br />
ASCII file that other programs like gnuplot or Microsoft Excel can read<br />
and process. IMEM-1.1 works with various meteoroid models which may<br />
include several populations of particles on bound orbits about the Sun<br />
having different densities, orbital and mass distributions and several<br />
streams of the interstellar dust grains having different densities, mass<br />
distributions, passing through the Solar system at various speeds and in<br />
various directions. IMEM-1.1 is a portable code written in FORTRAN 90,<br />
which is supported by the GNU Project and thus available on almost every<br />
platform. IMEM-1.1 -GUI is a Java program that provides a user friendly<br />
interface. It can be used to set most of IMEM-1.1 parameters, run<br />
calculations and view results as a text or as a set of graphs. Being a<br />
Java application, IMEM-1.1 -GUI can be used on every platform that has<br />
Java. Model file provided with IMEM-1.1 contains data on meteoroids of<br />
mass between $latex 10^{-18}$ and $latex 10^2$ grams on the orbits with<br />
pericentric distances between 0.05 and 6 a.u., eccentricities between 0<br />
and 1 and inclinations between 0 and 180 degrees. <strong>How to get:</strong> I have<br />
no right to distribute the code, as it belongs to ESA. If you want to<br />
get it, please send a message to Gerhard.Drolshagen at esa.int<br />
